Step\-by\-step guide to sell access to your chat:

1\) Invite this bot as an administrator of your group\.
The only permission it needs is the permission to invite\.

2\) Run `/get_id` command to get your group's id \(Note, do this inside the group\)\.

3\) Run `/sell group_id eth_price members_limit`\.
Where _group\_id_ is id gotten in previous step,
_eth\_price_ is the price to join your group in ether, and
_members\_limit_ is the max number of accesses can be bought\.
_members\_limit_ is an optional parameter\.
If not provided number of places will be unlimited\.

4\) Enter the returned page and make transaction to the blockchain\.

5\) Access the shop info using `/get_shop_info group_id` command\.
_group\_id_ could be found in the second step\.
